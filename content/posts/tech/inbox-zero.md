One thing that makes a big difference in my work life is knowing how to process emails. 
I remember having an email inbox full of old emails that I did not need anymore. I used to miss emails a lot, and that used to happen because I was kind of using my email as a to-do list.
Now my inbox is always clean, and I get less distracted (and waste less time) when checking emails.
What I did/do summarises in the steps below:

Clean your inbox with a Fresh Start:

1. ****[Fresh Start: The Email DMZ](http://www.43folders.com/2006/01/04/email-dmz):** Start here by cleaning your inbox 

Maintain your inbox clean:

1. I always unsubscribe to any marketing emails, newsletters I don’t read. If you don’t unsubscribe, the email will appear again in your inbox in a few days.
2. Keep in your inbox only to the most important stuff, like direct emails, for example. I use filters to help me with this: [http://www.43folders.com/2006/03/13/filters](http://www.43folders.com/2006/03/13/filters)
3. Process new emails this way:
    1. Do you care about this email? Does it requires any action? will you need this email later? If not, Delete it.
    2. If you think you might need the email in the future (in a very remote future), and you don’t need it now, just archive it. You can easily find it in the future using the search tools.
    3. If the email requires an action that would take you less than 2 min to be completed, do the action now and then delete/archive the email
    4. Archive/delete all emails that are not relevant anymore.
