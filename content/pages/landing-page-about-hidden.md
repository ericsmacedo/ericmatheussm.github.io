Hi,

My name is Eric Macedo (as you already know from the website name) and this is
my blog.

My objective with this blog (at least today) is to share small pieces
of information about what I am working on and learning. I am an Electrical
Engineer, currently working as a Digital Design Engineer. I am also a 
Christian, and I love tech! From that, I can say that the posts will probably
be about Signal Processing, Python, VIM, apologetics, etc.

Don't expect me to write very detailed posts here. Instead, I will try to
share something small frequently.

I hope this blog helps you somehow! :)
